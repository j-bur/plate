Plate is divided into three key projects:

1. **Core**: At the heart of Plate lies our advanced plugin system, meticulously crafted for `slate-react`. It's our guiding principle to prioritize a separation of concerns, ensuring a clean, clutter-free environment for your project development.
2. **Plugins**: We provide an extensive suite of plugin packages, aimed at optimizing editor behaviors, hooks, serialization, and normalization, among other functionalities. The real magic? They're **100% unstyled**. You have the creative freedom to style it as you envision, ensuring your project remains as unique as you are.
3. **Components**: Accessibility and customization are central to our mission. That's why we offer Plate CLI-generated components, serving as the building blocks of your own customized component library. Design it your way, make it accessible for all.

### Author's Note

> As the author of @udecode/plate, I understand the challenges of building an app with an editor. I spent months working on this project and realized that many other developers were facing the same difficulties. That's why I decided to open-source this work and invite others to collaborate.
> 
> Open-source is a long-term investment that can help us create a bug-free product and reduce technical debt. By working together, we can build a fully-featured editor that will benefit us all. I encourage you to join this collaboration and contribute to the project. Together, we can create something truly great.
