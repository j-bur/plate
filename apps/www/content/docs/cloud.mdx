## Features

Plate Cloud is the official Plate plugin and cloud service for image and attachment uploads, automatic server-side image resizing, and future Plate cloud services.

It supports:

- Drag and drop uploading of images and attachments
- Paste uploading of images and attachments
- Using a file picker for uploading images and attachment
- Drag resize of images with server-side image resizing which optimizes download speed
- Automatically delivers high DPI images to high DPI devices and normal sized images to everyone else

Your usage of Plate Cloud supports the development of Plate.

You can start by [getting a free Portive API key](https://admin.portive.com/).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @udecode/plate-cloud
```

## Usage

To use Plate Cloud, you will need to [get a free Portive API key](https://www.portive.com/).

To get the value to save to your database, use `editor.cloud.getSaveValue()`. This is required for Plate Cloud because of the asynchronous nature of uploads.

### Options

```tsx
/**
 * CloudPlugin options
 */
export type CloudPlugin = {
    /**
   * Options for connecting to the official Portive Cloud service
   *
   * Either `apiKey` or `authToken` must be provided
   */
  apiKey?: string | () => string | () => Promise<string>;
  authToken?: string | () => string | () => Promise<string>;
  apiOrigin?: string;
  /**
   * Only used for testing to prepopulate the current state of uploads
   */
  uploadStoreInitialValue?: Record<string, Upload>;
};

/**
 * CloudAttachmentPlugin options (none at the moment)
 */
export type CloudAttachmentPlugin = {};

/**
 * CloudImagePlugin options
 */

export type CloudImagePlugin = {
  /**
   * Choose a max width/height to display for when an image is first update.
   * The image is always uploaded at full size so this is not about the
   * stored resolution of the image.
   */
  maxInitialWidth?: number;
  maxInitialHeight?: number;
};
```
