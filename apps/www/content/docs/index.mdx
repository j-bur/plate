description: Rich-text editor plugin system for Slate & React.
---

Plate is a robust toolkit, designed to streamline and simplify your [Slate](https://docs.slatejs.org/) development process around three key projects: **Core**, **Plugins**, and **Components**.

## Core

At the very heart of Plate is our advanced plugin system. Tailored for `slate-react`, it embodies our commitment to prioritizing a separation of concerns. By endorsing a clean, decluttered environment, we ensure seamless project development.

## Plugins

We offer an expansive array of plugin packages. These are optimized to improve editor behaviors, hooks, serialization, normalization, and other functionalities. The distinctive edge of these plugins? They're **unstyled**, enabling you to imprint your creative design vision on them.

## Components

**Accessibility** and **customization** sit at the heart of our mission. Hence, we offer Plate **CLI**-generated components. They serve as the foundational elements of your personalized component library. With Plate, you can design your components, your way.
