description: Rich-text editor plugin system for Slate & React.
---

Plate is a robust toolkit, designed to streamline and simplify your [Slate](https://docs.slatejs.org/) development process around 4 key projects: **Core**, **Plugins**, **Primitives** and **Components**.

## Core

The cornerstone of Plate is our state-of-the-art plugin system. Custom-made for `slate-react`, it reflects our dedication to prioritizing a separation of concerns. By promoting a clean, decluttered environment, we facilitate smooth and efficient project development.

## Plugins

We offer an expansive array of plugin packages. These are optimized to improve editor behaviors, hooks, serialization, normalization, and other functionalities. The distinctive edge of these plugins? They're **headless**, enabling you to imprint your creative design vision on them.

## Primitives

Beyond headless plugins, we also provide primitive components built on top of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/). These are unstyled, accessible components designed for building high-quality design systems.

## Components

Recognizing the appeal of a visually pleasing start, we offer Plate CLI-generated components, built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). These components can serve as a reference or foundation for your own component library, enabling you to build a unique, accessible, and visually pleasing user interface.
