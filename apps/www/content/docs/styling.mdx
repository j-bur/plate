By default, plate plugins have no component: you'll need to plug them.
There is multiple ways to style your editor.

## Examples

Custom Plate UI from scratch: https://github.com/azzlack/plate-tailwindcss

## Create Component

To create an element component:
```tsx
import { PlateRenderElementProps } from '@udecode/plate';

export const CustomElement = ({ attributes, children }: PlateRenderElementProps) => (
  <div {...attributes}>
    {children}
  </div>
);
```

To create a leaf component:
```tsx
import { PlateRenderLeafProps } from '@udecode/plate';

export const CustomLeaf = ({ attributes, children }: PlateRenderLeafProps) => (
  <span {...attributes}>
    {children}
  </span>
);
```

## Plugins

To register a single component, use the plugin property `component`:

```tsx
const plugins = [
  createParagraphPlugin({
    component: ParagraphElement,
  }),
  createLinkPlugin({
    component: LinkElement,
  }),
];
```

## Components

To register all the components in one place, use `createPlugins` second parameter.
This way, the UI is decoupled from the plugins. Note that there is no difference with the plugin `component` property.

It's an object whose property keys are plugin keys and whose property values are React components.

```tsx
const plugins = createPlugins(plugins, { 
  components: {
    [ELEMENT_PARAGRAPH]: ParagraphElement,
    [ELEMENT_LINK]: LinkElement,
  },
});
```

### Plate UI

Plate UI provides a styled component for each plugin as you can see in the examples. 

These are **not packaged**. See [Components](components) for more information.


### Custom Components

You can create your own component.

- The custom element props interface should extend `PlateRenderElementProps<V>` where `TElement` is the element type.
- The custom leaf props interface should extend `PlateRenderLeafProps<V>` where `TText` is the leaf type.

## CSS

Plate adds a `class` attribute to all elements and leaves.

Its value is the plugin `type` prefixed by `slate-`, for example:

- `slate-p` for the paragraph
- `slate-ul` for the list
- `slate-li` for the list item
- ...

That way, you can style your nodes with class selectors.
